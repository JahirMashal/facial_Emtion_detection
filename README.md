# Bank Customer Emotion Detection

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system to detect emotions in bank customers from textual interactions. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning algorithms, the system can analyze customer feedback, chat logs, and other textual data to determine the emotional state of customers. This information can help banks improve customer service, tailor responses, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

## Features

- *Emotion Detection*: Identifies emotions such as happiness, anger, sadness, and surprise from customer interactions.
- *Real-time Analysis*: Processes and analyzes data in real-time to provide immediate insights.
- *Scalability*: Designed to handle large volumes of data, making it suitable for banks of any size.
- *User-Friendly Interface*: Provides an intuitive interface for bank staff to view and interpret emotional data.

## Technologies Used

- *Deep Learning Framework*: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- *NLP Libraries*: NLTK, spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers
- *Data Handling*: Pandas, NumPy
- *Web Framework*: Flask or Django (for deploying the model)
- *Frontend*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the user interface)
- *Database*: PostgreSQL or MongoDB (for storing customer interaction data)

## Model Architecture

The emotion detection model is based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer architecture, which is well-suited for processing sequential text data. The architecture includes:

- *Embedding Layer*: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.
- *LSTM/GRU Layer or Transformer Encoder*: Captures the temporal dependencies and context within the text.
- *Dense Layers*: Fully connected layers for emotion classification.
- *Softmax Activation*: Outputs the probabilities of each emotion class.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset comprising labeled customer interactions, which includes various emotional expressions. The dataset is preprocessed to remove noise and standardized to ensure consistency.

## Preprocessing Steps

1. *Text Cleaning*: Remove punctuation, special characters, and stop words.
2. *Tokenization*: Split text into individual tokens (words or subwords).
3. *Embedding*: Convert tokens into numerical vectors using pre-trained embeddings like GloVe or BERT.
4. *Padding*: Ensure all sequences have the same length by padding shorter sequences.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using a training dataset and validated using a separate validation set. Key metrics used for evaluation include:

- *Accuracy*: The percentage of correct predictions.
- *Precision and Recall*: Measures of the relevancy and completeness of the predictions.
- *F1 Score*: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
